# legofinalproject
Welcome to my fall 2021 final project.
It was absolutely fun to work on a project that challenged my abilities.
A great desire of mine is to incorporate machine learning tactics in order create learning games for young children. 
As a mother it is absolutely beautiful to see how my child uses her imagination and developmental abilities to play and understand.

My child also reminds me that, even as an adult, the best way to learn is through play. 
That is the reason I chose to work on this project.

I remained resilient and found household items to replace tools I did not have. Because of this I created the start of my own build kit and workshop. I plan to keep building toys to expand on my knowledge base of machine learning.

I researched different codes to test when troubleshooting.
I reached out to mentors and continously asked questions.


I learned how to:
- Use the Raspberry Pi camera to look for objects
- If an object is detected, use that object to change the face
- Match the object detected to a reaction or emotion
- Change the look of the face to represent a reaction
- Return to step 1 to look for the next object to react to
