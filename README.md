Welcome to my fall 2021 final project.
It was absolutely fun to work on a project that challenged my abilities.
A great desire of mine is to incorporate machine learning tactics in order create learning games for young children. 
As a mother it is absolutely beautiful to see how my child uses her imagination and developmental abilities to play and understand.

My child also reminds me that, even as an adult, the best way to learn is through play. 
That is the reason I chose to work on this project.

I remained resilient and found household items to replace tools I did not have. 
Because of this, I created the start of my own build kit and workshop.
I am starting from scratch and starting earlier than I thought I would.

I learned to solder and to use and build hardware.
I plan to keep building toys to expand on my knowledge base of machine learning.
I am passionate about this field and I know that I will build amazing things in the future.

I researched different codes to test when troubleshooting.
I reached out to mentors and continously asked questions.

This is a great artificial intelligence exercise.
What is next for me includes finding a program that will support TensorFlow so that I can teach the machine learning raspberry pi cameras
to detect my face. I want to help destroy the narrative that AI facial recognition cannot detect faces of people of color that well.

I sincerely enjoy this project and will continue to work on it in my spare time. This is work is what I am passionate about. Thank you for this opportunity.

Please navigate to https://github.com/NatureNai/legofinalproject/blob/main/DiaryRobotFace for the link to my personal diary regarding this project and more personal thoughts I endured and will continue to endure.

P.S. I shamelessly used this project to help with my camera shyness. As I continue with more projects in the future I hope that you take notice of my growth.

I learned how to:
- Use the Raspberry Pi camera to look for objects
- If an object is detected, use that object to change the face
- Match the object detected to a reaction or emotion
- Change the look of the face to represent a reaction
- Return to step 1 to look for the next object to react to
